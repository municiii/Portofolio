    <h1><strong>About Joy</strong></h1>
    <div class="first">
    <p>In 2002 January 5,on a beautiful Saturday morning, I was born. I was born in Nairobi where i grew up. I started school when i was three years old in Thomas Burke Primary School. While i was there,i discovered my talent of singing.I also became the liturgical leader,incharge of the choir.I completed my primary school education in the same school in 2015.I passed in the national examination and was able to join a prestigious national school,Limuru Girls' School.I experienced a life on my own and got to acquire many values. I joined music club where i became the music conductor. I also joined the lincoln ambassadors who helped me come up with projects for the society.i completed my high school education in 2019 and passed in my secondary national examinations.</p>

    <p>I developed a passion for technology along the way but i didn't know much about it. It is also not very common with the ladies so i wanted to challenge myself and use the skills acquired to develop myself and society. A friend referenced me to Moringa School where i am currently learning about software development and I am having a lot of fun coding.</p>
