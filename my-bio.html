I joined music club where i became the music conductor. I also joined the lincoln ambassadors who helped me come up with projects for the society.i completed my high school education in 2019 and passed in my secondary national examinations.
    <p>I developed a passion for technology along the way but i didn't know much about it. It is also not very common with the ladies so i wanted to challenge myself and use the skills acquired to develop myself and society.
